	  	  <h4>Lectures:</h4>
	  <p>
	    <b>4/30:</b> Revision, practice exam. Worked solutions are above. See you on Friday for the final! 
	  <br>
	    <b>4/28:</b> Sections 12.1 & 12.2 - geometric sequences, sum of geomestric sequences and annuities. 
	  <br>
	  <b>4/23:</b> Section 11.3 - uniform, exponential and normal distributions. These are the most common distributions, being useful for modelling all kinds of phenomena, including <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4461" target=_blank>sports</a>.
	  <br>
	  <b>4/21:</b> Section 11.2 - expected value, variance, standard deviation, median of a continuous distribution. These are all the usual measures of "center" and "spread" of a distribution.
	  <br>
	  <b>4/16:</b> Section 11.1 - continuous probability distributions, continuous random variables. Cumulative density functions. Things like <a href="http://basin.earth.ncu.edu.tw/download/courses/seminar_MSc/2009/1105-2_A%20review%20of%20earthquake%20occurrence%20models%20for%20seismic%20harzard%20analysis.pdf" target=_blank>earthquake statistics</a> are pretty interesting, and has led to some <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110914/full/477264a.html" target=_blank>spectacular failures</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_prediction" target=_blank>prediction</a>. </a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com" target=_blank>Nate Silver</a> has written some interesting stuff on this, and plenty of other topics in statistics.
	  <br>
	  <b>4/14:</b> Section 10.4 - applications of differential equations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function" target=_blank>Logistic growth</a> is a very useful application of first order linear equations, and predator-prey models like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotkaâ€“Volterra_equation" target=_blank>Lotka-Volterra</a> can be solved by separation of variables, and are highly enjoyable.
	  <br>
	  <b>4/9:</b> Finished talking about zombie growth. Section 10.2 - first-order linear differential equations. Integrating factors and the like.
	  <br>
	  <b>4/7:</b> Went over some of the questions from Midterm II. Section 10.1 - elementary and separable differential equations. Talked a little bit about zombie population growth, which happens to be <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/494625/exponential-decay-help">well documented</a> in the literature.
	  	  <br>
	  <b>4/2:</b> Finished Section 9.6 - double integrals. Finding the volume underneath a surface, double integrals over non-rectangular regions, and changing the limits of integration for difficult integrals.
	  <br>
	  <b>3/26:</b> Started section 9.6 - double integrals, up to Fubini's theorem. This will be all that will be on Midterm II next Monday.
	  <br>
	  	  <b>3/24:</b> Section 9.4 - Lagrange multipliers. General method plus a few examples, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_maximization_problem" target=_blank>utility maximization</a>.
	  <br>
	  <b>3/19:</b> Finished Section 9.2 - partial derivatives with a quick discussion of Newton's law of gravity. Covered Section 9.3 - maxima and minima. Introduced the discriminant, local max/min, saddle points, did a couple of examples. Set Quiz 7 as a take-home quiz as a result.
	  <br>
	  <b>3/17:</b> Section 9.2 - partial derivatives. Definitions, meaning, first and second derivatives. Climbed a virtual Mt. Mansfield USING MATH
	  <br>
	  <b>3/12:</b> Talked a little bit about <a href="http://vimeo.com/79098420">robots</a>, <a href="http://heathscience.pbworks.com/f/Dinosaurs+Article.pdf">dinosaurs</a> and how they ran. Finished off Section 9.1 - multivariate functions, and went home early to avoid the blizzard!
	  <br>
	  <b>3/10:</b> Went over some questions from <a href="MATH20_2014_files/midterm1Solutions.pdf">Midterm 1</a>. Started Section 9.1 - functions of several variables. Covered definitions of multivariate functions and their domain and range. Definition of and graphing planes, as well as some plots of other surfaces such as <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicParaboloid.html">hyperbolic paraboloids</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid">hyperboloids</a>. I know I promised you dinosaurs -- we will get to them on Wednesday!
	  <br>
	  <b>2/24:</b> Topics for Wednesday's midterm exam. Covered all of 8.4 - improper integrals, instead. A bit of discussion about continuously compounded interest from Section 8.3 (which we will otherwise skip for now).
	  <br>
	  <b>2/22:</b> Finished off Section 8.2 - volumes of solids of rotation. Calculated the volumes of footballs, icecream cones, and the Earth.
	  <br>
	  <b>2/12:</b> Finished off Section 8.1 - integration by parts. Covered the second half of Section 8.2, ie., the average of a function.
	  <br>
	  <b>2/10:</b> Went over the solutions to <a href="MATH20_2014_files/quiz3Solutions.pdf">Quiz 3</a>. Started Section 8.1 - integration by parts, including <a href="http://t.co/3AjIRLL4k7" target=_blank>column integration</a>. Solutions to the exercises from the end of class are <a href="MATH20_2014_files/integrationByPartsExamples.pdf" target=_blank>here</a>.
	  <br>
	  <b>2/5:</b> Finished Section 7.5 with a few worked examples calculating the area between curves. Talked about a fun application of this from economics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_curve" target="_blank">Lorenz curves</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target=_blank>Gini index</a>, which shows how income inequality is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient#US_income_Gini_indices_over_time" target=_blank>increasing</a>.
	  <br>
	  <b>2/3:</b> Finished off Section 7.4 by talking about calculating areas, and began Section 7.5 - the area between curves. Will do more examples of this on Wednesday.
	  <br> 
	  <b>1/29:</b> <a href="MATH20_2014_files/HW7.6.xlsx" target="_blank">Here</a> is a spreadsheet which should help you with HW 7.6. After getting distracted by trigonometry and <a href="http://www.hedonometer.org">hedonometer</a> we talked integration rules and integration by substitution from Section 7.4. Quiz 2 on definite integrals and numerical integration.
	  	  <br>
	  <b>1/27:</b> Section 7.6 - numerical integration. Trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. Started Section 7.4 - the fundamental theorem of calculus. (Will cover substitution and area in Wednesday's lecture.) 
	  	  <br>
	  <b>1/22:</b> Section 7.3 - area and the definite integral. HW online, due Monday 1/27. Next lecture will skip ahead to Section 7.6 - numerical integration. 
	  	  <br>
	  	  <b>1/15:</b> Watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udHB3tftPz4" target="_blank">movie</a> and showed we can math as hard as Jake Gyllenhaal. Finished Section 7.1, covered the essence of Section 7.2 - integration by substitution (but we'll do some more examples in the next lecture). 
	  	  <br>
	  	  <b>1/13:</b> Introduction. Started Section 7.1 - definition of the antiderivative, and rules for polynomials, exponential and trig functions.
